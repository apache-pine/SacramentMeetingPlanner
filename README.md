# Overview

This is a basic web app built using .NET Framework and C#. This web app was built to aid in preparing for sacrament meetings. It allows users to create a program for a sacrament meeting, with all the different roles one would expect in such a meeting. The program is saved in a database and can be edited at a later time. This program offers full CRUD operations in the database using Entity Framework. This was built specifically with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in mind, but could be used for any church or organization that has similar meetings.
